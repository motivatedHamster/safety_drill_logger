Attempting to add devise for user authentication:

error:
/home/action/.gem/ruby/2.1.1/gems/bundler-1.6.2/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:34:in `block in setup': You have already activated spring 1.3.6, but your Gemfile
 requires spring 1.3.5. Prepending `bundle exec` to your command may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)

commented out 'spring' in Gemfile, ran 'bundle', uncommented 'spring' in Gemfile, ran 'bundle' again
rails g model user
success!

added gem 'devise' to Gemfile
bundle install
rails g devise:install

per devise default message, added home#index to root route
per devise default message, added flash messages to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

merge OK from Mel:
create a page with all the upcoming drills (include what classroom they're for, what kind of drill, etc).
  you'll need to seed data for this.
  make it so you can filter on this page by teacher and drill type.
  here are some gems that might be helpful: https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Table_Builders

merged models -> master, new branch views

added above to seeds.rb

rake db:seed
error:
Unable to autoload constant Drill_type, expected /home/action/workspace/ruby210/safety_drill_logger/app/models/drill_type.rb to define it

possibly due to using "Drill_type.create" in seeds.rb, changing to "DrillType.create"
rake db:seed
seems to have worked?  :)

git branch views
git branch views_datagrid

added "gem 'datagrid'" to Gemfile
bundle install

trying below per: https://github.com/bogdan/datagrid/wiki/Frontend
	"rails generate datagrid:scaffold <model in plural>"

rails generate datagrid:scaffold drills
console appears to be locked, 20 min
restarting machine

gem install datagrid -v 1.3.7
"1 gem installed"

rails generate datagrid:scaffold drills
appears to have worked!
      create  app/grids/drills_grid.rb

getting error browsing to /drills/
	something about no method 'name' in Drill

following tutorial at http://guides.railsgirls.com/devise/
adding authentication

merged views->master

added 'pg' to Gemfile
changed adapter in database.yml to postgresql, altered db names
is it just that easy?


built dropdown list for selecting classroom.teacher_id per this page: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/advanced-forms
drop down list populates OK but classroom object doesn't get a new teacher_id :(
built nested form for editing classroom.drill_types at classrooms/#/edit/
need to be able to add new drill_types in classrooms/new and classrooms/#/edit/
 - Ben may help with this

attempting to add due date to drills table:
rails g migration add_date_due_to_drills date_due:date
looks like it worked

xremove ID and create date columns - removed ID, removed create date
need to:
 	xadd due date
	and a drills/edit link columns to datagrid page
		maybe instance eval? column(:completed) { completed? }
		https://github.com/bogdan/datagrid/wiki/Columns
		did it like this:
			column(:id, :html => true) do |record|
				link_to "Edit", edit_drill_path(record)
			end
